**LiberCarta** is a home for independent voices and the stories they dare to tell.

We celebrate the richness of independently crafted books. These may come from self-published authors, small publishing houses, or unconventional creative efforts. This is a place where writers don't wait for permission to be read. Here, authors own their narratives, and readers discover stories beyond the expected.

## Why We Exist

In a world flooded with algorithms, bestseller lists, and mainstream publishing gates, indie authors often go unseen. Yet their stories are brave, bold, and beautifully different. We created LiberCarta to change that.

This space exists to:

- Celebrate the creativity and spirit of independent authors
- Help readers find thoughtful, powerful books that may not appear on bestseller shelves
- Build a slow, meaningful literary community that values story over status

## Who It's For

LiberCarta is for:

- Self-published writers looking for a curated, respectful place to showcase their work
- Small press authors who want more visibility outside social media noise
- Readers who crave honest, original, sometimes messy, always human stories

Whether you've published a chapbook, an experimental novel, a children's bedtime story, or a deeply personal memoir, we want to hear from you.

## How It Works

We keep it simple:

1. Indie authors submit their work via our [submission form](https://tally.so/r/wdgoQA)
2. We review, lightly curate, and feature books and authors on this site
3. Readers explore and connect through books, bios, and future conversations

We are not a storefront. We link directly to the author's own sales page or shop, giving full control to the creators.

## Our Name

**LiberCarta** is a word we made up: part *"liber"* (Latin for book or freedom), and part *"carta"* (paper or map). It's a symbol of how we see indie publishing: free, hand-drawn, exploratory.

A map made of books. A library made of brave voices.
